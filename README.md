This is my personal portfolio website built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. It includes a contact form powered by Resend.

## Features

- **Next.js** for a robust, server-rendered application.
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid and responsive styling.
- **Framer Motion** for smooth and interactive animations.
- **Resend** for handling contact form submissions.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrittoRuban/portfolio
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Resend API key and your own email address:

   ```plaintext
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
